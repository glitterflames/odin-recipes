        <h1>Easy, Creamy Mac and Cheese</h1>
        <img src="../images/macandcheese.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the same recipe as J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ingredient-stovetop-mac-and-cheese-recipe">3 ingredient stovetop mac and cheese,</a> but with less cheese. Maybe it's my brand of cheese, but I find a full 6 ounces as the original recipe calls for makes a gloopier sauce. I like my sauce a little thinner, but it's all a matter of personal preference.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>6 ounces evaporated milk</li>
            <li>4 ounces cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the macaroni in a medium saucepan, in just enouch cold water to cover the pasta. Bring to a boil and salt; cook about 6 minutes until pasta is nearly al dente, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add evaporated milk. Once it is boiling, add cheese and reduce heat to low. Cook about 2 minutes, stirring, until the milk and cheese have formed a rich, smooth, creamy sauce. Season and serve.</li>
